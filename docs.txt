JavaScript interacts with the HTML using the Document Object Model, or DOM. 
The DOM is a tree of objects that represents the HTML. You can access the HTML using the document object, 
which represents your entire HTML document.

The querySelector() method takes a CSS selector as an argument and 
returns the first element that matches that selector.

 If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the const keyword to declare it instead of the let keyword. 
 Always place your script at the end of the page

 button.onclick = myFunction;
In this example, button is the button element, and myFunction is a reference to a function. When the button is clicked, myFunction will be called.

<p id="info">Demo content</p> 
Example Code
const info = document.querySelector("#info"); 
info.innerText = "Hello World"; 
The example above would change the text of the p element from Demo content to Hello World.
